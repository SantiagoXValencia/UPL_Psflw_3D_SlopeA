# UPL_Psflw_3D_SlopeA
Python: Ultimate Pit Limit solved by Pseudoflow algorithm. With slope angle asociated to each block

Code based on S. √Åvalos work: https://github.com/geometatqueens/2020-Pseudoflow-Python .
The improvement is to add variable slope angle precedences from block model specification.
The code could have bugs.
Block model arbitrarily modified for testing code. Four zones included for four different slope angles.
